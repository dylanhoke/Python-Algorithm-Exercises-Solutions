Binary trees are linked lists that have more than one next nodes.

binary search tree's adhere to certain rules:
    all nodes left of a node have to be smaller
    all nodes right of that node has to be larger

    whats most important is that one side of the node options is larger and one side is smaller

Binary Search Trees are linked listst that have node patterns

leaf nodes are the nodes that are at the bottom and dont have any next options

    the highest node needs EVERYTHING to one side being smaller or larger.

if the highest node is larger than its branches but smaller than 1 leaf it is not a binary
search tree

if statements make comparisons between each pointer inside of these searches

binary search trees are Log(n)
    meaning they have exponential growth which isnt the fastest right off the bat but it is
    best effective when searching large amounts of information

Inserting into a binary search tree:

    use an if statement to move the cursor down the tree
        cur = cur.left

    from here we need to determine if our number is greater or less than our current node
        cur.right = new Tree(3)
